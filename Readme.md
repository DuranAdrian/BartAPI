This app is my second learning project. This time I'm mainly working with JSON, making API calls, using different threads,
and mapkit for locations.

The idea behind this project is to have a simple Bart viewer.
Using the BART public API, I am able to pull the respective data and have it display accordingly. 

The user will be able to:
* View a list of all Stations.
* View a specific station's details, such as location on Apple Maps, name, address.
* View next train at specific station.
* What the fare between 2 stations is + time of arrival.
* Any advisory information such as Train Count and Elevator Information.
