This app is my second learning project. This time I'm mainly working with JSON, making API calls, using different threads, timers, some animations, and mapkit for locations. NOTE: App is visible better in native dark mode.

## DESCRIPTION
The idea behind this project is to have a simple Bart viewer.
Using the BART public API, I am able to pull the respective data and have it display accordingly. 

The user will be able to:
* View a list of all Stations.
* View a specific station's details, such as location on Apple Maps, name, address and trains arriving.
* View next trains at closest station.
* What the fare between 2 stations is + time of arrival.
* Any advisory information.
